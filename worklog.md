Task ID: 1
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Build a D&D 5e Virtual Tabletop with an autonomous AI Dungeon Master agent — full-stack Next.js 16 app with Prisma/SQLite, LLM-driven DM decision loop, dice rolling, tactical combat grid, scene image generation, and a dark-fantasy Russian-language narrative UI.

Work Log:
- Explored project scaffold (Next.js 16, shadcn/ui, Prisma/SQLite, z-ai-web-dev-sdk) and read the LLM + image-generation skill docs.
- Designed and pushed a Prisma schema (Player, Monster, InventoryItem, ChatMessage, DiceRoll, Scene, GameState) to SQLite via `bun run db:push`.
- Built the game backend in `src/lib/game/`:
  - `types.ts` — shared TypeScript types for game state, resolutions, snapshots.
  - `dice.ts` — dice-notation parser + fair RNG roller (d20, damage, ability modifiers).
  - `state.ts` — DB helpers: snapshot, DM-context builder, damage/heal/move/inventory/gold mutations, monster AI movement, combat-end detection.
  - `seed.ts` — opening scenario: hero Алдрик (Fighter lv.1), 5 starting items, 2 hidden goblins, misty-forest-ruins scene, Russian intro narrative.
  - `json.ts` — robust JSON extractor for LLM output (handles markdown fences / trailing commas).
  - `dm-agent.ts` — the autonomous DM decision loop: (1) fetch game context, (2) LLM call #1 plans mechanics as JSON (rolls, DC/AC, success/failure effects, image prompt), (3) backend rolls dice fairly, (4) applies state changes (HP, inventory, grid, gold), (5) runs monster turn deterministically (move-toward-player + attack), (6) LLM call #2 narrates the full resolved round in Russian, (7) persists messages + advances round. Includes graceful fallbacks if the LLM returns bad JSON.
- Built 4 API routes:
  - `GET /api/game/state` — seeds if needed, returns full snapshot.
  - `POST /api/game/action` — runs the DM agent for a player action, returns resolved event + refreshed snapshot.
  - `POST /api/game/image` — generates a dark-fantasy scene illustration via z-ai image SDK, saves to `public/scenes/`, sets as active scene.
  - `POST /api/game/reset` — wipes and re-seeds the world.
- Built the frontend (`src/app/page.tsx` + `src/components/dnd/`):
  - `CharacterSheet` — portrait, HP bar (color-coded), AC/gold, 6 ability scores with modifiers, scrollable inventory with type badges.
  - `CombatGrid` — 10×10 tactical grid, player + monster tokens with HP bars, combat/round indicator, legend.
  - `SceneViewer` — atmospheric scene image with vignette, location caption, generating badge.
  - `ChatPanel` — DM narrative bubbles (serif, amber), player bubbles, quick-action chips (Attack/Look/Move/Speak), textarea input, "DM is thinking" animated indicator.
  - `DiceLog` — recent dice rolls with notation, result, total, success/fail.
  - Responsive 3-column desktop layout / stacked mobile layout; sticky header + footer (`min-h-screen flex flex-col`, `mt-auto`).
- Customized `globals.css` with a warm dark-fantasy palette (crimson primary, amber-gold accents, stone backgrounds), custom scrollbars, and animations (flicker, pulse-glow, fade-up, dice-roll).
- Generated 2 initial images via z-ai CLI: `forest-ruins.png` (opening scene) and `hero.png` (player portrait).
- Fixed a bug found during testing: hidden monsters weren't shown in the DM context, so the LLM couldn't target them for damage on the first combat turn. Fixed by revealing hidden threats in `getDMContext` and adding a nearest-monster fallback in damage targeting.

Stage Summary:
- Fully functional D&D 5e VTT with an autonomous AI DM. Verified end-to-end via Agent Browser:
  - Page renders cleanly (3-column dark-fantasy layout, all panels populated, no console errors).
  - Exploration actions produce rich Russian narrative + new AI-generated scene art.
  - Combat triggers correctly (hidden goblins activate), attack rolls use real d20+modifier vs monster AC, damage is applied to the correct monster, monster deaths are tracked, monster turns run (move-toward-player + attack), round counter advances, combat ends when all monsters dead.
  - Dice log records attack + damage rolls.
  - Mobile responsive; sticky footer; lint clean (0 errors, 0 warnings).
- Tech: Next.js 16 App Router, TypeScript, Prisma/SQLite, z-ai-web-dev-sdk (LLM + image generation), shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS 4, Lucide icons.
- Artifacts: `prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/lib/game/*`, `src/app/api/game/*`, `src/components/dnd/*`, `src/app/page.tsx`, `public/scenes/{forest-ruins,hero}.png`.

Task ID: 2
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Add multiplayer co-op mode with room codes + initiative-based turn-order combat so friends can play together.

Work Log:
- Restructured the Prisma schema to be room-scoped: added `Room` (code, host, combat flags, turnIndex), made `Player` belong to a room (unique by roomId+name, added weaponName/weaponNotation/isHost/isAlive/initiative fields), added `InitiativeEntry` (combatant name/type/initiative/order/monsterId/isAlive), and added `roomId` to Monster/InventoryItem/ChatMessage/DiceRoll/Scene with cascade deletes. Force-reset the DB and regenerated the Prisma client.
- Installed `socket.io` + `socket.io-client` and built a stateless socket.io relay mini-service at `mini-services/game-sync/` (port 3003, `bun --hot`). It maps sockets to room codes and broadcasts `room:refresh` pings so every client re-fetches state — keeping the DB as the single source of truth while giving near-instant multi-client sync.
- Built character class presets (`src/lib/game/presets.ts`): Воин (Fighter), Следопыт (Ranger), Маг (Wizard), Жрец (Cleric) — each with balanced level-1 stats, a weapon + damage notation, starting items, and a distinct color. Party members are auto-placed at different grid positions by join order.
- Rewrote `state.ts` to be fully room-scoped: snapshot, DM-context builder (now lists the whole party + their weapons, hidden threats, and the current initiative order), damage/heal/move/inventory/gold mutations keyed by roomId, `rollInitiative()` (d20+DEX for players, d20+2 for monsters, sorted descending with tie-breaks), `getCurrentCombatant`, `countAlive`, and nearest-player/monster helpers for monster AI.
- Rewrote `dm-agent.ts` for initiative-based turns:
  - Split `resolvePlayerAction` (LLM plan + dice + effects, NO monster turn) from `advanceTurn` (auto-runs monster turns in initiative order until a living player is up, skipping dead combatants).
  - `processPlayerAction` enforces turn order (rejects actions when it isn't the actor's turn during combat), resolves the acting player's action, and — if the action triggered combat — rolls initiative and advances through monster turns. The opening strike resolves before initiative; if the triggerer is first in order they're skipped (already acted).
  - Fixed an opening-strike bug: hidden monsters are now revealed BEFORE the attack damage is applied (plan first → activate hidden → apply → roll initiative), so the triggering player's first hit actually lands.
  - Monster turns narrated via a dedicated LLM call; player actions narrated via a second LLM call. Initiative rolls are logged to the dice history.
- Built room-scoped API routes: `POST /api/game/room/create`, `POST /api/game/room/join` (rejects mid-combat joins + duplicate names), and room-scoped `GET /state?room=`, `POST /action`, `POST /reset`, `POST /image`.
- Built the frontend:
  - `Lobby.tsx` — create/join room flow with hero-name input + 4 class-preset cards.
  - `PartyPanel.tsx` — all party members with HP bars, host crown, "Вы" badge, current-turn highlight, dead overlay.
  - `InitiativeTracker.tsx` — horizontal turn-order bar with initiative numbers, current-turn pulse, dead markers.
  - Updated `CharacterSheet.tsx`, `CombatGrid.tsx` (multi-player tokens + stacking), `ChatPanel.tsx` (speaker names, turn-lock banner "Ваш ход" / "Ход: X — дождитесь своей инициативы", disabled input when not your turn).
  - `page.tsx` — lobby/game routing via localStorage session, socket room join, refresh-ping listener + 4s polling fallback, copy-room-code button, real-time state updates.
- Fixed a Prisma-client staleness issue: after adding the `Room` model, the running Next dev server kept a cached `@prisma/client` without `db.room`. Resolved by clearing the `.next` cache and restarting the dev server.

Stage Summary:
- Fully functional multiplayer co-op D&D VTT, verified end-to-end via Agent Browser + curl (simulating 2 players):
  - Host created room `D9YANB` as Алан (Следопыт); second player Мира (Маг) joined via the same code — both appear in the party panel and on the grid at distinct positions; the join was picked up by player 1 via real-time sync.
  - Combat triggered by an attack: initiative rolled for all 4 combatants (d20+DEX), order determined (e.g. Алан 23 > Гоблин-стрелок 20 > Гоблин-разведчик 17 > Мира 8). Monsters act automatically on their turn (move toward nearest player when far, attack when adjacent). Players can only act on their turn — input is locked otherwise with a clear banner.
  - Verified a full round across two players + two monsters: Алан's opening strike hit the goblin-scout (21 vs AC 13, 7 dmg), Мира cast fire bolt on her turn (7 dmg to goblin-archer), round advanced to 2 and turn returned to Алан — with player 1's browser unlocking via polling sync.
  - Turn-lock, initiative tracker, party panel, and real-time sync all confirmed working in the browser. Lint clean (0 errors/warnings). Both Next.js (3000) and game-sync (3003) servers running.
- Artifacts: `prisma/schema.prisma`, `mini-services/game-sync/`, `src/lib/game/{presets,state,seed,dm-agent,socket,types}.ts`, `src/app/api/game/{room/create,room/join,state,action,reset,image}/route.ts`, `src/components/dnd/{Lobby,PartyPanel,InitiativeTracker,CharacterSheet,CombatGrid,ChatPanel}.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`.

Task ID: 3
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: BG3-style character creator (more classes/races/backgrounds), translate game title to English, polish UI + fix bugs, then write detailed deployment guide (variant B).

Work Log:
- Expanded character content (`src/lib/game/presets.ts`): 12 D&D 5e classes (Fighter, Barbarian, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Monk, Wizard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Cleric, Druid, Bard), 9 BG3-flavored races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Tiefling, Gnome, Half-Orc, Dragonborn, Githyanki) each with stat bonuses + a racial trait, and 10 backgrounds (Soldier, Acolyte, Criminal, Folk Hero, Noble, Sage, Urchin, Outlander, Entertainer, Charlatan) each with a gold bonus + skill + flavor item. Added `applyRaceBonuses()` to compute final stats (capped at 18).
- Updated `types.ts` (added `Stats`, `RacePreset`, `BackgroundPreset`; added `race/raceName/background/backgroundName` to PlayerState) and the Prisma schema (`Player.race/raceName/background/backgroundName`), force-reset the DB and regenerated the client.
- Updated `seed.ts`: refactored to export `seedRoomContent(roomId, input)`; `createPlayer` now applies race bonuses to stats, adds background gold, and grants the background item. The DM context builder now reports the hero as e.g. "Тифлинг Cleric, происхождение Служитель" so the LLM can narrate race/background flavor.
- Updated room/create + room/join API routes to accept `classId/raceId/backgroundId`; rewrote reset route to read the caller's existing race/class/background from the DB before deletion (preserves the hero across resets).
- Built `CharacterCreator.tsx` — a multi-step BG3-style wizard (Race → Class → Background → Name) with a clickable step indicator, a "Случайно" (randomize) button, and a sticky live-preview panel showing the computed final stats (with race bonus deltas highlighted), HP/AC/gold, weapon + damage notation, the racial trait, and the background skill. Rewrote `Lobby.tsx` to route into the creator.
- Translated the game title to English: "Тёмные Хроники" → **DUSKFALL** (layout metadata, page header, footer, loading screen, lobby, creator). Narrative stays Russian (DM speaks Russian for immersion).
- Updated `CharacterSheet.tsx` + `PartyPanel.tsx` to show "Раса Класс · Происхождение · ур.N" for each hero.

Variant B (deployment):
- Added production artifacts: `Dockerfile` (multi-stage: builds Next.js standalone + copies Prisma client/CLI + game-sync; runs both processes via `start.sh`), `start.sh` (first-boot `prisma db push`, then launches game-sync:3003 + Next.js:3000), `.dockerignore`, `docker-compose.yml` (app + Caddy gateway + persistent `duskfall-data` volume for SQLite), `Caddyfile.prod` (same XTransformPort=3003 routing as the sandbox, with auto-HTTPS for real domains), `.env.example`.
- Wrote `DEPLOYMENT.md` — a detailed Russian guide covering: VPS+Docker Compose (recommended, step-by-step from server rental → Docker install → code upload → env config → domain/HTTPS → run → invite friends → backup/update), Railway, Render, single-port PaaS caveat, env-var reference, optional PostgreSQL migration, post-deploy checklist, and a troubleshooting section.

Stage Summary:
- Character creator verified end-to-end in the browser: created "Кассия" (Тифлинг Cleric, Служитель) — race bonuses applied (INT 11=10+1, CHA 14=12+2), background gold (22=10+12) and item ("Святой амулет" via Acolyte... actually Печать рода for noble) granted. All 12 classes, 9 races, 10 backgrounds render in the wizard; live preview updates on selection.
- Combat still fully functional with the new creator: Кассия attacked, initiative rolled (Goblin Scout 21 > Goblin Archer 8 > Кассия 2), killed the goblin-scout (7 dmg → 0 HP, inactive), turn advanced through the goblin-archer and back to Кассия in round 2. Turn-lock + initiative tracker confirmed in browser.
- Title is now DUSKFALL everywhere; lint clean (0 errors/warnings); both servers (3000 + 3003) running; no console errors.
- Artifacts: `src/lib/game/{presets,types,seed,state,dm-agent}.ts`, `src/components/dnd/CharacterCreator.tsx`, `src/components/dnd/{Lobby,CharacterSheet,PartyPanel}.tsx`, `src/app/{layout,page}.tsx`, `src/app/api/game/{room/create,room/join,reset}/route.ts`, `Dockerfile`, `start.sh`, `.dockerignore`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Caddyfile.prod`, `.env.example`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

Task ID: 2
Agent: talent-data-writer
Task: Write 120 class talents (10 per class × 12 classes) for DUSKFALL.

Work Log:
- Read `/home/z/my-project/worklog.md` (prior tasks 1–3: VTT scaffold, multiplayer co-op, BG3-style creator with 12 classes / 9 races / 10 backgrounds) and `src/lib/game/types.ts` to confirm the `Talent`/`TalentEffect` discriminated-union shapes (14 effect variants).
- Created `src/lib/game/talent-data.ts` exporting `CLASS_TALENTS: Record<string, Talent[]>` and the `getTalentsForClass(classId)` helper.
- Authored exactly 10 talents for each of the 12 classes (`fighter, barbarian, paladin, ranger, rogue, monk, wizard, sorcerer, warlock, cleric, druid, bard`) — 120 total. IDs follow `${classId}_t${1-10}`. Names + descriptions are in Russian, D&D 5e / BG3-flavored ("Второе дыхание", "Ярость варвара", "Божественная кара", "Клинок_HEX", "Адское возмездие", "Вдохновение барда", etc.).
- Spread effects thematically per class — each class uses 9–10 distinct effect types (well above the 5-type minimum). E.g. fighter leans on counterattack/crit_range/damage_bonus_flat/ac_bonus/hp_bonus/extra_attack_chance/reroll_miss_once; barbarian on damage_bonus_flat/damage_resistance_flat/crit_bonus_dice/heal_on_kill/initiative_bonus/vampiric_pct; rogue on crit_range/crit_bonus_dice/damage_bonus_flat/reroll_miss_once/initiative_bonus; etc.
- Balanced all numerics for a level-2 character per the spec: counterattack chance 0.25–0.3, damage_bonus_flat 1–3, ac_bonus 1–2, hp_bonus 5–12, damage_resistance_pct 0.15–0.25, damage_resistance_flat 1–3, crit_range minRoll 19, crit_bonus_dice 1–2, extra_attack_chance 0.3–0.4, vampiric_pct 0.1–0.25, initiative_bonus 2–3, save_bonus 1–2, heal_on_kill notation "1d6" or "1d8". Counterattack damageNotation matches weapon style (fighter/paladin "1d8+3", rogue/monk "1d6+X", wizard/sorcerer/warlock "1d8", ranger "1d6+3").
- Verified with `bunx tsc --noEmit src/lib/game/talent-data.ts` — clean (0 errors). Verified with `bun run lint` — clean (0 errors, 0 warnings). Counted talents: 10 per class, 120 total.

Stage Summary:
- Deliverable complete: `/home/z/my-project/src/lib/game/talent-data.ts` contains 120 strictly-typed, lint-clean talents — 10 per class × 12 classes, thematically aligned with D&D 5e class identities, with at least 9 distinct effect types per class and level-2-appropriate numeric balance. Exports `CLASS_TALENTS` and `getTalentsForClass(classId)`. Ready to be wired into the character-creator / level-up flow (a future task can call `getTalentsForClass(player.classId)` to present the 10 choices on level-up and store picked ids in `PlayerState.selectedTalents`).

Task ID: 4
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: BG3-style character creator expansion (point-buy + 120 talents + level-up), random unique adventures, hard atmosphere rules, UI fixes (non-stretched image, smaller grid).

Work Log:
- Added 12 D&D classes already existed; kept. Added point-buy: 5 bonus stat points distributable at creation (capped 18), persisted as bonusStr/Dex/Con/Int/Wis/Cha on Player + shown live in the creator preview.
- Designed a 14-type TalentEffect discriminated union (counterattack, damage_resistance_pct/flat, crit_range, crit_bonus_dice, extra_attack_chance, heal_on_kill, initiative_bonus, damage_bonus_flat, ac_bonus, vampiric_pct, reroll_miss_once, save_bonus, hp_bonus) in types.ts.
- Delegated 120 talents (10×12 classes) to a subagent (Task ID 2) with a tight spec; wrote `talent-data.ts` + a `talents.ts` engine module that resolves a player's selected talents into combat modifiers and rolls reactive effects (counterattack, vampiric heal, heal-on-kill, damage reduction).
- Added XP/leveling: Player.xp + XP_THRESHOLDS (L2=200, L3=600, L4=1200, L5=2000), `awardXP` (raises level, proficiency, maxHP, sets pendingLevelUp), `applyLevelUpTalent`, `xpForMonster`. Killing a monster awards XP to the killer (and to a counterattacker who lands the killing blow). Combat engine now applies talent modifiers: player damage bonus + vampiric + heal-on-kill on hits; monster attacks use effectiveAC, apply damage reduction, and may trigger a counterattack.
- Added a new `stats` step to the CharacterCreator (point-buy UI with +/- buttons, live pool counter, stat cap, modifier display). The live preview now reflects bonus-adjusted final stats.
- Built `LevelUpModal.tsx` (Dialog) listing the player's class talents (filtered to unselected) with effect badges; calls POST /api/game/levelup. Wired into page.tsx so it opens when `you.pendingLevelUp` is true.
- Added 8 random starting locations (`locations.ts`): Mistwood ruins, Forgotten crypt, Burned village, Silver caverns, Death marsh, Black tower, Shipwreck shore, Ruined monastery — each with a unique Russian intro hook, an English image prompt, and themed hidden enemies. Room creation picks one at random so every adventure begins somewhere different.
- Strengthened the DM planning system prompt with 6 hard "atmosphere & realism" rules: (1) items exist ONLY if in inventory — player cannot conjure items by assertion; (2) strict pseudo-medieval era — no gunpowder/electricity/modern tech/sci-fi; (3) every adventure unique; (4) freedom with realistic consequences; (5) D&D 5e balance (artifacts must have drawbacks, ≤50 gold/session early); (6) dark-fantasy tone. The DM context now lists each hero's full inventory so the LLM can verify what items actually exist.
- Fixed UI: SceneViewer now uses `object-contain` with `max-h-[42vh]` so the location image is never stretched/distorted (letterboxed naturally). CombatGrid max-width reduced 460→340px so the grid is more compact.
- Fixed a charClass/classId mismatch bug: players store `charClass="Fighter"` but talents are keyed by lowercase `classId`. Added `getClassIdByCharClass()` and used it in talents.ts, LevelUpModal, and the levelup API.

Stage Summary:
- Verified end-to-end: created a Fighter, point-buy allocated (СИЛ 18), random location chosen (shipwreck shore), combat deals damage with talent bonuses, killing monsters awards XP (100/25 XP per monster), crossing 200 XP sets pendingLevelUp, the LevelUpModal opens showing the 10 Fighter talents with effect descriptions, picking "Рипоста" (counterattack 30%) saved it and cleared the flag. Talent effects (counterattack, damage reduction, AC bonus, vampiric, etc.) are applied in the combat engine.
- Atmosphere rules baked into the DM prompt: tested context shows full inventory per hero so the LLM can enforce "no free items"; era/balance/uniqueness constraints are explicit.
- Vision-verified: scene image no longer stretched, grid is a reasonable size, no layout issues. Lint clean (0 errors/warnings), both servers running, no console errors.
- Artifacts: `src/lib/game/{talent-data,talents,locations,types,seed,state,dm-agent,presets}.ts`, `src/components/dnd/{CharacterCreator,LevelUpModal}.tsx`, `src/app/api/game/levelup/route.ts`, updated `src/components/dnd/{SceneViewer,CombatGrid}.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/api/game/{room/create,room/join}/route.ts`.

Task ID: 5
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Fix join-by-code step order; add abilities system (innate/class/scrolls) shown in creator + character sheet; honest answer on going online.

Work Log:
- Fixed the "Войти по коду" flow: previously it jumped straight to the name step with the code field embedded. Now the step order is mode-dependent — create: race→class→background→stats→name; join: code→race→class→background→stats→name. Added a new "code" step (first for join) with its own input; removed the code input from the name step. `canNext` requires a 6-char code on the code step.
- Built `src/lib/game/abilities.ts`: an Ability type (source: race|class|talent|scroll, consumable flag, castNotation, castType, uses). Catalogs:
  - RACIAL_ABILITIES (9 races, ~2-3 each, dnd.su/SRD-flavored): e.g. Elf darkvision + fey ancestry; Dwarf poison resilience; Tiefling fire resistance + Hellish Rebuke (2d6 reaction); Half-Orc relentless endurance + savage attacks; Dragonborn breath weapon (2d6 cone); Githyanki psionics + mind discipline.
  - CLASS_ABILITIES (12 classes, 1 starting feature each): Fighter Second Wind (1d10 heal), Barbarian Rage, Paladin Divine Smite (2d8), Ranger Hunter's Mark (1d6), Rogue Sneak Attack (1d6), Monk Martial Arts, Wizard Arcane Recovery, Sorcerer Font of Magic, Warlock Pact Magic, Cleric Channel Divinity, Druid Wild Shape, Bard Bardic Inspiration (1d6).
  - SCROLL_SPELLS (7 consumable spells): Fireball (8d6), Cure Wounds (1d8+3), Shield (+5 AC), Magic Missile (3d4+3), Darkness, Lightning (8d6), Mass Cure (3d8). Scroll-type inventory items auto-appear as castable consumable abilities.
  - `computeAbilities(player, inventory)` merges race + class + talents + scroll-items; `previewAbilities(raceId, classId)` for the creator.
- Added a starting scroll ("Свиток магической стрелы") to the Wizard preset so the scroll system is demonstrable out of the box.
- Wired abilities into the CharacterCreator preview (race + class abilities shown with badges "народ"/"класс" and cast notation).
- Added an "Способности" section to the CharacterSheet (in-game): lists all computed abilities with source badges (народ/класс/талант/свиток), marks consumable scrolls with an amber "расходуемый" badge and a scroll icon, shows cast notation (урон/лечение/эффект). Talents chosen at level-up appear here too.
- Updated the DM context to tag scroll items as "[расходуемое заклинание-свиток]" so the LLM treats them as castable consumables and removes them on use.

Stage Summary:
- Verified in browser: join flow now starts at the code step, then race→class→background→stats→name (correct order). Character creator preview shows abilities (e.g. Tiefling: Тёмное зрение, Сопротивление огню, Адское возмездие). In-game character sheet shows the full ability list with source badges and consumable markers — a Tiefling Wizard correctly displays 3 racial + 1 class ability + 1 consumable scroll. Lint clean (0 errors/warnings), no console errors.
- Artifacts: `src/lib/game/abilities.ts`, updated `src/components/dnd/{CharacterCreator,CharacterSheet}.tsx`, `src/lib/game/{presets,state}.ts`.

Task ID: env-and-llm-restore
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Add user's .env file, restore OpenRouter (NVIDIA Nemotron + Qwen3 + Llama) + Ollama as fallback providers alongside GLM + Gemini.

Work Log:
- Discovered the working tree had been reset to an old git commit — all files from the 7 subagent tasks (combat-v2, world-v2, progression-v2, visual-v2, opt-backend, opt-frontend, dungeon-gen, final-audit) were lost (never committed to git). The project reverted to the state from early session 1, before llm.ts existed. dm-agent.ts used ZAI SDK directly.
- Added user's .env to project root with: GLM_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY (user's "QWEN_API_KEY" was actually an OpenRouter key starting with sk-or-v1-, so renamed to OPENROUTER_API_KEY).
- Created src/lib/game/llm.ts from scratch with multi-provider fallback chain:
  1. GLM (z.ai) — glm-4.6 → glm-4-plus → glm-4-air → glm-4-flash (primary)
  2. Gemini (Google) — gemini-2.0-flash → gemini-1.5-flash → gemini-1.5-flash-8b
  3. OpenRouter — qwen3-next-80b → nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b → llama-3.3-70b → gpt-oss-120b → dolphin-mistral-24b
  4. Ollama (local) — configurable model (default llama3.2)
  5. z-ai-web-dev-sdk sandbox config (last resort)
- Each provider has dedicated env vars: GLM_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY, OLLAMA_BASE_URL+OLLAMA_MODEL.
- Updated dm-agent.ts: removed direct ZAI SDK usage (getZAI + 5 zai.chat.completions.create calls). Replaced with chatComplete() and chatStream() from llm.ts. Also fixed the role:"assistant" → role:"system" bug in all system prompts (was sending system prompts as assistant messages).
- Updated .env.example with all provider variables documented.
- Lint: clean (0 errors). tsc: 0 errors in LLM-related code (8 pre-existing errors in old combat logic, unrelated to LLM changes).
- Dev server: running on port 3000, homepage returns 200 with DUSKFALL branding.

Stage Summary:
- LLM chain restored with NVIDIA Nemotron, Qwen3, Llama 3.3, GPT-OSS (via OpenRouter) + Ollama as fallbacks after GLM + Gemini.
- User's .env has 3 keys active: GLM + Gemini + OpenRouter. Ollama skipped (no OLLAMA_BASE_URL set).
- llm.ts auto-detects OpenRouter keys (sk-or-v1- prefix) in QWEN_API_KEY or LLM_API_KEY for backwards compatibility.
- CRITICAL NOTE: The 7 subagent tasks from earlier this session (combat-v2, world-v2, progression-v2, visual-v2, opt-backend, opt-frontend, dungeon-gen, final-audit) were lost due to a working tree reset. The project is at the old HEAD commit state. Those features need to be re-implemented in a future session.
